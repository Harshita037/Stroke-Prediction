This project focuses on predicting stroke risk using a comprehensive dataset of 5,111 patient records sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes a diverse set of demographic, lifestyle, and medical features such as age, gender, BMI, glucose levels, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, residence type, and smoking behavior. These variables provide meaningful insight into the factors that may influence stroke occurrence, allowing for a deeper understanding of how different health indicators interact. The project involves thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for machine learning models. Exploratory data analysis is performed to uncover trends, correlations, and potential risk patterns within the population. Multiple predictive models are then developed and evaluated to determine which approach most effectively identifies individuals at higher risk of stroke. By combining data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and model comparison, this project demonstrates how machine learning can support early detection efforts and contribute to improved healthcare decision‑making.
